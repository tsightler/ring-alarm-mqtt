# ring-mqtt
This script leverages the excellent [ring-client-api](https://github.com/dgreif/ring) to provide a bridge between MQTT and suppoted Ring devices such as alarm control panel, lights and cameras ([full list of supported devices and features](#current-features)).  It also provides support for Home Assistant style MQTT discovery which allows for simple Home Assistant integration with minimal configuration (assuming MQTT is already configured), including an optional [Hass.io Addon](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt-hassio-addon) for users of that platform.  It can also be used with any other tool capable of working with MQTT as it provides consistent topic naming based on location/device ID.

## !!! Important MQTT changes for Home Assistant >=0.113 !!!
Prior to Home Assistant 0.113 it was highly recommended to configure birth messages for the MQTT component by manually modifying configuration.yaml.  This way ring-mqtt could monitor for restarts of the Home Assistant server and automatically resend devices and state updates after a restart.  The example for this setting in the documtation, and prior versions of this script, used hass/status as the topic for these messages.

However for Home Assistant >=0.113 birth/last will messages have been enabled by default but, unfortunately, uses the default topic of homeasssitant/status instead.  To comply with the defaults for Home Assistant going forward the config.json included with this script has been modified to use the homeassistant/status topic instead so, for new installs, no special configuration should be needed for most cases.

For existing users who have implemented the previously recommended configuration, it will continue to work without changes after the upgrae, however, for consistency with future configurations it is now recommended to revert the Home Assistant MQTT configuraiton to defaults and modify the config.json file to change the hass_topic value from hass/status to homeassistant/status.  You can also completely switch to UI configuration for the MQTT component after making this change if you wish.

## Standard Installation (Linux)
Make sure Node.js (tested with 10.16.x and higher) is installed on your system and then clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt.git`

Change to the ring-mqtt directory and run:

```
chmod +x ring-mqtt.js
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies.  Edit the config.js and enter your Ring account user/password and MQTT broker connection information.  You can also change the top level topic used for creating ring device topics as well as the Home Assistant state topic, but most people should leave these as default.

### Starting the service automatically during boot
I've included a sample service file which you can use to automaticlly start the script during system boot as long as your system uses systemd (most modern Linux distros).  The service file assumes you've installed the script in /opt/ring-mqtt and that you want to run the process as the homeassistant user, but you can easily modify this to any path and user you'd like.  Just edit the file as required and drop it in /lib/systemd/system then run the following:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable ring-mqtt
systemctl start ring-mqtt
```

## Docker Installation
Ring-mqtt is now on Docker Hub!  While you're still welcome to build your own image from the Dockerfile you can now install and update by pulling directly from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull tsightler/ring-mqtt
```

Or just run directly (Docker will automatically pull the image if it doesn't exist locally):

```
docker run --rm -e "MQTTHOST={host_name}" -e "MQTTPORT={host_port}" -e "MQTTRINGTOPIC={ring_topic}" -e "MQTTHASSTOPIC={hass_topic}" -e "MQTTUSER={mqtt_user}" -e "MQTTPASSWORD={mqtt_pw}" -e "RINGTOKEN={ring_refreshToken}" -e "ENABLECAMERAS={true-or-false}" -e "RINGLOCATIONIDS={comma-separated location IDs}" tsightler/ring-mqtt
```
In ring-mqtt version >=3.2.0 the Docker build supports the use of a bind mount for persistent storage, this is used to store updated refresh tokens in a persistent fashion.  While this is not absolutely required, it can be useful as refresh tokens eventually expire and are renewed automatically by the script.  Using persistent storage will store these refreshed tokens in a state file which will be read during script startup and the connection to the Ring server will attempt to use this token before any manually configured token.  If you do not specify a bind mount the script will continue function without state, as in previous versions, but during restarts you may have to manually regenerate a token and modify the configuration value when they expire.  For more details see ([Authentication](#authentication)).  Here is an example docker run command with a bind mount which mount this host directory /etc/ring-mqtt to the container path /data:
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source=/etc/ring-mqtt,target=/data -e "MQTTHOST={host_name}" -e "MQTTUSER={mqtt_user}" -e "MQTTPASSWORD={mqtt_pw}" -e "RINGTOKEN={ring_refreshToken}" tsightler/ring-mqtt
```
Note that only **RINGTOKEN** is technically required but in practice at least **MQTTHOST** will likely be required as well (unless you use the host network option in "docker run" command).  **MQTTUSER/MQTTPASSWORD** will be required if the MQTT broker does not accept anonymous connections.  Default values for the environment values if they are not defined are as follows:

| Environment Variable Name | Default |
| --- | --- |
| MQTTHOST | localhost |
| MQTTPORT | 1883 |
| MQTTRINGTOPIC | ring  |
| MQTTHASSTOPIC | hass/status |
| MQTTUSER | blank |
| MQTTPASSWORD | blank |
| ENABLECAMERAS | false |
| RINGLOCATIONIDS | blank |

When submitting any issue with the Docker build, please be sure to add '-e "DEBUG=ring-mqtt"' to the Docker run command before submitting.

## Authentication
Ring has made two factor authentication (2FA) mandatory thus the script now only supports this authentication method.  Using 2FA requires acquiring a refresh token for your Ring account and seting the ring_token parameter in the config file (standard/Hass.io installs) or passing the token with the RINGTOKEN environment variable (Docker installs).

There are two primary ways to acquire this token:

**Option 1:** Use ring-auth-cli from the command line.  This command can be run from any system with NodeJS installed.  If you are using the standard Linux installation method after running the "npm install" step you can execute the following from the ring-mqtt directory: 
```
node node_modules/ring-client-api/ring-auth-cli.js
```

If you are using the Docker, you can execute:
```
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint node_modules/ring-client-api/ring-auth-cli.js tsightler/ring-mqtt
```
For more details please check the [Two Factor Auth](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Two-Factor-Auth) documentation from the ring client API.

**Option 2:** This method is primarily for Home Assistant add-on, but also works with the standard script method (it does not work for the Docker method).  If you leave the ring_token parameter blank in the config file and run the script, it will detect that you don't yet have a refresh token and start a small web service at http://<ip_of_server>:55123.  Simply go to this URL with your browser, enter your username/password and then 2FA code, and it will display the Ring refresh token that you can just copy/paste into the config file.

For more details please check the [Two Factor Auth](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Two-Factor-Auth) documentation from the ring client API.

### ***Important Note regarding expiring refresh tokens***
Refresh tokens do expire and this can cause issues during restarts since you may have to manually acquire a new token.  Starting with version 3.2.0 of this script, updated refresh tokens are automatically stored in a persistent manner where possible.  The exact nature of how these updated tokens are stored varies slightly based on installation type as described below:

**Standard Installation:** The script will attempt to automatically write new tokens to the config.json file.  Note that this means the script must be running under an account which has permissions to this file/directory.

**Docker Installation:** The script will attempt to store refresh tokens in /data/ring-state.json.  Note that for this file to be persistent accross restarts you must provide a bind mount to this path during the docker run stage as descibed in the Docker installation section.  If /data/ring-state.json doesn't exist during startup, or if the system fails to authenticate using this token, it will fall back to using the RINGTOKEN envrionment variable, if defined.

**Home Assistant Add-on:** The script will store refresh tokens in /data/ring-state.json.  If /data/ring-state.json doesn't exist during startup, or if the system fails to authenticate using this token, it will fall back to using the ring_token value defined in the configuration.  If no tokens are available, or if all tokens fail to authenticate, it will start the web service and allow you to generate a new token.  Note that it is no longer required to manually copy/paste the token into the config file in this case, once you generate the token via the web UI it will save the token in /data/ring-state.json and automatically attempt to connect using this new token.  The ring_token value can stay completely blank in this case, however, if you prefer to manually create a token without using the Web UI, it is still possible to set this value in the config, but it is no longer required.

### ***Important Note regarding the security of your refresh token***
Using 2FA authentication opens up the possibility that, if your Home Assistant environment is comporomised, an attacker can acquire the refresh token and use this to authenticate to your Ring account without knowing your username/password and completely bypassing any 2FA protections.  Please secure your Home Assistant environment carefully.

Because of this added risk, it's a good idea to create a second account dedicated to this script.  This allows actions performed by this script to be easily audited since they will show up in activity logs with their own name instead of that of the primary account.  Also, you can control what devices the script has access to and easily disable access if nafarious activity is detected.

## Config Options
| Config Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| host | Hostname for MQTT broker | localhost |
| port | Port number for MQTT broker | 1883 |
| ring_topic | Top level topic for ring devices, default should be fine for most cases | ring |
| hass_topic | Home Assistant state topic, used to monitor for restarts to automatically republish devices | hass/status |
| mqtt_user | Username for MQTT broker | blank |
| mqtt_pass | Password for MQTT broker | blank |
| ring_token | The refresh token received after authenticating with 2FA - See Authentication section | blank
| enable_cameras | Enable camera support, otherwise only alarm devices will be discovered | false |
| enable_modes | Enable support for Location Modes for sites without a Ring Alarm Panel
| location_ids | Array of location Ids in format: ["loc-id", "loc-id2"] | blank |

By default, this script will discover and monitor enabled devices across all locations, even shared locations for which you have permissions.  To limit locations you can create a separate account and assign only the desired resources to it, or you can pass location_ids using the appropriate config option.  To get the location id from the ring website simply login to [Ring.com](https://ring.com/users/sign_in) and look at the address bar in the browser. It will look similar to ```https://app.ring.com/location/{location_id}``` with the last path element being the location id.

## Using with MQTT tools other than Home Assistant (ex: Node Red)

MQTT topics are built consistently during each startup.  The easiest way to determine the device topics is to run the script with debug output as noted below and it will dump the state and command topics for all devices, the general format for topics is as follows:

```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/<ha_platform_type>/<device_id>/<prefix>_state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/<ha_platform_type>/<device_id>/<prefix>_command
```

An example for the Smoke/CO listener:
```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/<ha_platform_type>/<device_id>/gas_state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/<ha_platform_type>/<device_id>/co_state

```

Or for a multi-level switch:
```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/switch/<device_id>/switch_state               <-- For on/off state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/switch/<device_id>/switch_brightness_state    <-- For brightness state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/switch/<device_id>/switch_command             <-- Set on/off state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/switch/<device_id>/switch_brightness_command  <-- Set brightness state

```

For cameras the overall structure is the same:
```
ring/<location_id>/camera/binary_sensor/<device_id>/ding_state      <-- Doorbell state
ring/<location_id>/camera/binary_sensor/<device_id>/motion_state    <-- Motion state
ring/<location_id>/camera/light/<device_id>/light_state             <-- Light on/off state
ring/<location_id>/camera/light/<device_id>/light_command           <-- Set light on/off state
ring/<location_id>/camera/switch/<device_id>/siren_state            <-- Siren state
ring/<location_id>/camera/switch/<device_id>/siren_command          <-- Set siren state
```

## Debugging
By default the script should produce no console output, however, the script does leverage the terriffic [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) package.  To get debug output, simply run the script like this:

**Debug messages from all modules** (Warning, this very verbose!)
```
DEBUG=* ./ring-mqtt.js
````

**Debug messages from ring-mqtt only**
```
DEBUG=ring-mqtt ./ring-mqtt.js
```
This option is also useful when using the script with external MQTT tools as it dumps all discovered sensors and their topics.  Also allows you to monitor sensor states in real-time on the console.

## Breaking changes in v3.0
The 3.0 release is a major refactor with the goal to dramatically simplfy the ability to add support for new devices and reduce complexity in the main code by implementing standardized devices functions.  Each device is now defined in it's own class, stored in separate files, and this class implements at least two standard methods, one for initializing the device (publish discovery message, subscribe to events and publish state updates) and a second for processing commands (only for devices that accept commands).  While this creates some code redundancy, it eliminates lots of ugly conditions and switch commands that were previously far too easy to break when adding new devices.

Also, rather than a single, global avaialbaility state for each location, each device now has a device specific availability topic.  Cameras track their own availability state by querying for device health data on a polling interval (60 seconds).  Alarms are still monitored by the state of the websocket connection for each location but, in the future, offline devices (such as devices with dead batteries or otherwise disconnected) will be monitored as well.

For those using this script with 3rd party MQTT tools (not Home Assistant) the state and command topics have been standardized to use consistent, Ring-like prefixes across topic names.  This way topic lengths for all devices are always the identical.  This makes internal processing in the code simpler and makes state and command topics consistent across both single and dual sensor devices.  For example, with 2.0 and earlier the state topic for the standaline co sensor would be:
```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/binary_sensor/<device_id>/state
```
While for the combined co/smoke listener it would be:
```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/binary_sensor/<device_id>/smoke/state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/binary_sensor/<device_id>/gas/state
```
This was inconsistent so now, with 3.0 the topics for the co sensor would be:
```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/binary_sensor/<device_id>/co_state
```
While for the combined device it will be
```
ring/<location_id>/alarm/binary_sensor/<device_id>/smoke_state
ring/<location_id>/alarm/binary_sensor/<device_id>/co_state

## Thanks
Many thanks to @dgrief and his excellent [ring-client-api API](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/) as well as his homebridge plugin, from which I've learned a lot.  Without his work it would have taken far more effort and time, probably more time than I had, to get this working.

Also thanks to [acolytec3](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/acolytec3) on the Home Assistant community forums for his original Ring Alarm MQTT script.  Having an already functioning script with support for MQTT discovery saved me quite a bit of time in developing this script.
